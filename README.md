# square-matrix-adder
This was a HTML/JavaScript assignment in First Year in our Next-Generation Technologies module.
We had to write code which would compute the entry-wise sum of any number of square matrices of the same size.

My original version was one one HTML file, with the JavaScript inline in a `<script>` tag in the head.
For GitHub I have split the JS off into a separate file.
